    "Food is an essential part of where you live. In particular, access to fresh, safe, and locally grown food is vital to individual and community health. Oftentimes, for instance, low income communities lack reasonable access to fresh produce and groceries for a variety of socioeconomic reasons. These neighborhood are known as \"food deserts,\" so identifying the best and worst neighborhoods in terms of access to grocery stores/supermarkets will allow us to determine which places are doing things well and where the focus and attention of future policymaking ought to lie. At the same time access to community-based food gardens provides great access to fresh, locally-grown produce. Finally, food safety violations give us important information about the quality of prepared-food options in a community."

Moreover, we believe that the submetrics of supermarket access, number of community \"grow gardens\", and number of food safety violations are three key indicators of overall food quality.\n",
